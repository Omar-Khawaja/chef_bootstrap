# chef_bootstrap

This script expedites bootstrapping nodes to Chef server

This script will check if the file specifying your nodes exist, and then
it will begin to bootstrap your nodes. If node names similar to the nodes
you are trying to bootstrap already exist on the chef server, this script
will automatically delete them first

Pay attention to the commented lines in the script where you need to insert
your own information.
